This diverse journey has shaped me into a multifaceted professional, with software development remaining my core strength.

* Team Leadership: Adept at building and guiding high-performing tech teams to deliver exceptional results.
* Architectural Approaches: Proficient in implementing advanced architectural concepts such as Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Microservices, CQRS and ES to create flexible and scalable software systems.

Outside of work, I'm passionate about:
